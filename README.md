# Eff's Tecmo Superbowl Records
 My Tecmo Superbowl Records Website

As of now, I am using this file as a placeholder brainstorm and to-do list. 

# User Stories - To Do:

- Add grid style to all pages (.content-wrapper)
- Style dropdown nav just like fixed side nav
- Latest Standings/Seasons below Nav 
- Right side interactive scroll menu of notable TSB players/records
- JS Audio on record MouseClick: 1 "down", 2 "set", 3+ "hut"
- Use proper soundboard for record ("touchdown" "interception" "first down" "sack.")
- Script to retrieve latest NFL scores
- Embedded highlight clips of TSB gameplay
- Create Parent site "Eff's Tecmo Superbowl"
    - Forum with member signup
    - Custom ROM page to share rom downloads
    - Online League Page (Original roster, latest rosters and original roster redrafts)
- JS idea: Create a passer rating calculator with form inputs
    - Make one for TSB formula and one for NFL formula
- Div background like a football field (white text and yard lines)
- Design laces for football header
- Design seams for football header
- Create class for team logo colors: border ridge with primary and seconary team colors, make each team's color a var(--variable-name).
- Style dropdown menu
- Interactive football game
    - Throwable football with mouse-over and mouse-button interactivity
    - Retro style (bonus if TSB sprites could be used)
    - Score keeping

BUGS/IMPROVEMENTS/KINKS TO FIX:
- Create a max-width media query to prevent over-stretching on ultrawide or having nav too far left (AND/OR) convert side nav to a column that floats left.
- Default zoom is too close on mobile. Find a fix to either adjust the scale or zoom out the display. Alternatively, make side nav display at the top so its all one column. Update: Changing all pixels to em/percentages, will use media queries to make a single column view for mobile.
