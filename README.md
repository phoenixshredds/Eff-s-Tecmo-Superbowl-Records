# User Stories - To Do:

# HTML & CSS:

[] Consider a flex alternative to grid with more simple code.

BUGS/IMPROVEMENTS/KINKS TO FIX:
[] Create a max[]width media query to prevent over[]stretching on ultrawide or having nav too far left (AND/OR) convert side nav to a column that floats left.
[] Default zoom is too close on mobile. Find a fix to either adjust the scale or zoom out the display. Alternatively, make side nav display at the top so its all one column. Update: Changing all pixels to em/percentages, will use media queries to make a single column view for mobile.
