            <p class="first-letter">Once upon a time there was a freewebs site called, "Eff, Att and Rew's Tecmo
                Superbowl Records." That
                site no
                longer exists.
                However, Eff (that's me) kept all of the records and continued to update them over the years.
                This website is the result of that record keeping combined with some web development skills.

        <div id="rules">
            <p class="football-title football-subtitle">Rules of Play:</p>
            <p class="first-letter">We don't just play the game however we want. There are certain rules we must follow
                for
                these records to
                be considered valid and fair. Anyone who has played TSB enough knows there are ways to cheat the
                system,
                so
                here
                are our rules:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>No lurching, which is where you dive at the QB immediately after the snap. Defensive lineman
                    used
                    must
                    grapple or drop back before pursuing the QB. All other defenders have no limits.</li>
                <li>No onside kicks unless tied or trailing in the 4th quarter or overtime. Any accidental onside
                    kicks
                    must
                    be punted away.</li>
                <li>When defending kicking attempts, use of 4th player down (rolb) is prohibited due to ability to
                    run
                    straight by the blockers.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                We used to not allow WRs to be used in the backfield on traditional running players, but have since
                changed
                that
                rule to allow freedom of position swapping. After all, no WR is going to be Bo Jackson or Christian
                Okoye.
            </p>
            <p>As this is all enforced via honor system. there are a few other considerations: We look down upon using
                save
                states to constantly re-try to play games for records. In general, we just play the games and they fall
                as
                they
                may.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="rosters">
            <p class="football-title football-subtitle">What about rosters?:</p>
            <p>You may have noticed the present records are with the original 1991 Tecmo Superbowl roster. New to
                this
                site is
                the inclusion of the 1993 roster (from the SNES version). I have finalized the roster to include
                updated
                schedule (modified to fit into 17 weeks for NES), accurate kr/pr (excluding defensive backs),
                playbooks,
                and simulation ratings. Any records with the '93 roster will count for the NES.</p>
            <p> A copy of all records will be made for the SNES version. As of now, we have no seasons in the books
                for
                SNES.</p>
